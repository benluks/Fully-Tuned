# Fully-Tuned

## Get Started

You know the drill. `cd` into the directory, and then:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```

## How to Play

When prompted, enter the notes separated by `, `. It's not case sensitive. (eg. `Ab, C#`.)
* Non case-sensitive
* any enharmonic spelling is accepted

For this prototype, some basic features like replay, skip, and quit are not implemented. Working on that.
